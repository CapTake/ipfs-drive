### Additional feature wishlist

Ordered from most likely to be implemented to far fetched

- report progress in the most detailed way possibile during IPFS operations
- load google static assets stuff (fonts) locally or from ipfs
- show file information like an icon based on extension, file size etc
- time machine to go back
- if a folder has an index.html, then it's a website/app and the index should open on click
- configurable integration with other IPFS static apps to open files
- "upload" local files
- multiple file/folder delete, move, copy
- chat with other users on the same page
- ability to 'follow' edits so that when someone else edits the drive you switch to the new hash too
- download folder as archive
- some way to guarantee availability using pins maybe
